// 1) EVEN OR ODD
//   a) What is the algorithm trying to achieve?
//     Determine if the input value is an even or odd number.

//   b) Algorithmic complexity?
//     O(1)

//   c) How was the algorithmic complexity determined?

// 2) ARE YOU HERE?
//   a) What is the algorithm trying to achieve? 
//     Finds which of the values from arr1 exist in arr2.

//   b) Algorithmic complexity?
//     O(n^2)

//   c) How was the algorithmic complexity determined?
//     The first loop iterates through arr1 setting el1 as the value of arr1[index] and for each iteration a second loop is iterating through arr2 setting el2 as the value of arr2[index] and comparing if el1 === el2.

//     Receive an input (array) and log out pairs of arr[i] and arr[j].

//   b) Algorithmic complexity?
//     O(n^2)

//   c) How was the algorithmic complexity determined?
//     Iterating through each element of the array and for each element loop through the array again and pair the element[index] with element[index + 1].


// 6) COMPUTING FIBONACCIS
//   a) What is the algorithm trying to achieve?
//     Creating an array of fibonacci numbers.

//   b) Algorithmic complexity?
//     O(n)

//   b) Algorithmic complexity?
//     O(log n)

//   c) How was the algorithmic complexity determined?
//     With each iteration, the length of the input is shortened (by half).

//     Return a random element in an array.

//   b) Algorithmic complexity?
//     O(1)

//   c) How was the algorithmic complexity determined?
//     The function contains a single line of code that randomizes the index value of the array element and returns it.
